/*

Atlassian has a number of different products, each containing different types of content. As an example, letâ€™s look at three of our products:

Jira - Issues

Confluence - Pages

Bitbucket - Pull Requests

We want to build a system that allows users to tag content from different products, and then to view content by tags. A goal of this system is that it should be built in a product-agnostic way, so that we could add new products in the future without a large amount of work.

There are three key experiences that we want to build here:

As a user, I can add, remove, and update tags on content
    Update: Create a new tag
N/A:    Remove Tag itself
For now:    Remove Tag on a given content.

As a user, I can click on a tag and see all content that has been associated with that tag
    retrieve the contentIds
// getContent

As a user, I can see a dashboard of popular tags
    // getPopularityByCount
        TBD    // getP

get
